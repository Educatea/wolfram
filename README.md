# Wolfram

This gem allows you to get data from Wolfram's API as an image URL.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'wolfram', github: 'Educatea/wolfram' 
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Now add your Wolfram API ID to your application.rb (You can get the ID from [here](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html))  

```ruby
ENV['WOLFRAM_APPID'] = "XXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXX"
```    

## Usage

```ruby
# Create an object from your query:    
w = Wolfram.ask('Your query goes in here')   

# Now you can get the img src from any subpod you like:   
w.my_subpod
```

## Example

```ruby
# First I create an object from my query
w = Wolfram.ask('y = 5x + 2, x from -10 to 10, y from -10 to 10')   
# Now I can get the image source from the subpod Plot    
w.plot    
# => "http://www5b.wolframalpha.com/Calculate/MSP/MSP19101fg872ai8476109i0000648201ic8b8i60ic?MSPStoreType=image/gif&amp;s=55"   
     
# This can be used in *.erb.html files:    
<img src="#{Wolfram.ask('y = 5x + 2, x from -10 to 10, y from -10 to 10').plot}">
```
